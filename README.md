🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Project
🔍 Project Title:
Cardiovascular Disease Predictor using Machine Learning

📘 Project Description:
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having cardiovascular disease based on health-related attributes using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest. The goal is to assist in early risk detection and preventive healthcare.
🎯 Objective:
To develop a machine learning model that predicts cardiovascular disease based on input health metrics.

To deploy the model using a web application for user-friendly interaction.
